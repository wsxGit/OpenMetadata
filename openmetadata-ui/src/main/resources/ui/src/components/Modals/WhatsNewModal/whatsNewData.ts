    changeLogs: {
      'Backend APIs': `- **Fully Qualified Name (FQN) Separator:** Allows "." in the entity names and is handled as an internal detail in OpenMetadata. Improved the fullyQualifiedName. The "." is still the separator and the entity names from source will not be changed at all.\n- **Consistent FQN Changes** across the OpenMetadata UI, backend, Python framework, or any client that you might use.\n- **Introduced Database Schema as part of FQN:** For each external data source, we ingest the database, as well as the tables that are contained underneath the schemas. The database schema has been added into the hierarchy. Displays the fully qualified name, instead of a snippet of the table name.\n- **[Authorizer and Policy Changes](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/issues/4199):** Enhanced flexibility for creating policies and assigning roles. The policies can be authored at a field level or domain level. \n- **User permissions** to update descriptions and tags will be dependent on the roles and permissions. One can create a role and provide the role permissions to update users in all teams.\n- **Supports Hard Deletion** of Entities through the UI, APIs, and ingestion: Hard deleting an entity removes the entity and all of its relationships. This will also generate a change event.`,
      Ingestion: `- **Refactored Service Connections:** To simplify the ingestion jobs from both the ingestion framework as well as the UI.\n- **JSON Schema based Connection Definition:** Worked on the full refactoring of the ingestion framework. We use the pydantic models automatically generated from the JSON schemas for the connection definition. A change in the JSON schema will reflect the changes in the UI form.\n- **Test Credentials:** Users can test the connector credentials to ensure that it reaches the source to extract metadata.\n- **Refactored Airflow Rest APIs:** Creating a custom airflow rest API directly on top of Airflow using plugins. This passes the connection information to automatically generate all the dags and prepares handy methods to help us test the connection to the source before creating the service.\n- **Dynamically Download DBT Manifest Files from Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage:** This way we can have any other process to connect to the DBT, extract the catalog, and put it into any cloud service. We just need the path name and workflow job details from the metadata extraction to be able to ingest metadata.`,
      'Frontend or UI Changes': `- **Supports Hard Deletion of Entities:** Permanently delete tables, topics, or services. When the entity is hard deleted, the entity and all its relationships are removed. Also generates a  change event.\n- **Dynamic “Add Service” Forms:** ‘Add Service’ form is automatically generated in the UI based on the JSON schema specifications for the various connectors supported in OpenMetadata.\n- **UI Support for Database Schema as part of FQN:**  All the entity pages now support Database Schema in the UI.\n- **Lineage Editor:** Improvements have been made to the lineage editor.\n- **Teams:** While signing up in OpenMetadata, the teams with restricted access are hidden and only the joinable teams are displayed.\n- **Team Owner:** An Owner field has been added to the Team entity. Only team owners can update the teams.\n- **Activity Feeds:** The Activity Feeds UI supports infinite scrolling.\n- **Add User:** A user can be added from the Users page`,
      'Security Changes': `- **Support Added to Refresh Tokens for Auth0 and Okta SSO:** The JWT tokens are refreshed silently behind the scenes to provide an uninterrupted user experience.\n- **Supports Custom OIDC SSO:** Integrate with your custom built OIDC SSO for authentication. This is supported both on the front end for user authentication as well as on the ingestion side.\n- **Azure SSO:** Support has been added for Azure SSO on Airflow.`,
      'Data Quality and Writing Tests': `- The Data Quality tab now displays the **description of tests**.\n- To improve performance, a **max time limit** has been set on queries. If they exceed the max time, then the query is canceled and the profiler will process the next query.\n- **Profiler Workflows** can now be deployed from the UI, allowing scheduled computations of the Data Profiler and Quality Tests. \n- **Multiple workflows** can be run for a single service in order to batch tables with similar requirements.`,
      Connectors: `- The service connection string has been **refactored** to be specific to each service. \n- A **dynamic service config form builder** has been implemented. \n- A **Test connection** button has been added for service connectors, so the configs can be tested and validated.\n- **Snowflake** connector has been optimized to extract only the relevant metadata.\n- Private key support has been implemented for **Snowflake** and **BigQuery** to allow users to connect with the data source using a private key.\n- **Hive** connector has been improved to support running against a secured Hive cluster.\n- **Databricks** data profiling requirements have been changed. Some changes have been made for ingesting the tables and the corresponding catalog and manifest file from DBT.\n- **BigQuery** and **Hive** now support partitioning. The partitioning details can be used by the Profiler to sample data and to capture metrics.\n- Lineage has been added to **MSSQL Usage**.\n- Lineage has been refactored in Usage sources.\n- Dashboard and chart filtering has been added for the **Tableau** connector.`,
      'Other Changes': `- OpenMetadata can now reach the services running in **Docker's host machine** by using “host.docker.internal” or “gateway.docker.internal” as the hostname.\n- A flag has been added to control if the **sample data** should be ingested or not when starting up Docker from CLI.\n- Now there's a way to differentiate if a **data source** is a table or a view. Also, one can know how many views are chained in **Lineage**.\n- Support has been added to **reset** the database and to **restart** the OpenMetadata server.\n- The Activity feed API supports **pagination**.`,

-   Users are advised to use database native tools to backup and store it in their object store for recovery.
-   bootstrap/bootstrap_storage.sh has been deprecated in favor of bootstrap/openmetadata-ops.sh

UI:
-   Activity has been improved. New update specific cards display critical information such as data quality test case updates, description, tag update or removal.
-   For Lineage, the Expand All button has been removed. A new Layers button is introduced at the bottom left corner. With the Layers button, you can add Column Level Lineage or Data Observability details to your Lineage view.
-   View Definition is now renamed as Schema Definition.
-   Adding Glossary Term view is improved. Now we show glossary terms hierarchically enabling a better understanding of how the terms are setup while adding it to a table or dashboard.
-  For Classification, users can set classification to be mutually exclusive only **at the time of creation**. Once created, you cannot change it back to mutually non-exclusive or vice-versa. This is to prevent conflicts of adding multiple tags that belong to same classification and later turning the mutually exclusive flag back to true.

API:
-   Table Schema's ViewDefinition is now renamed to SchemaDefinition to capture Tables' Create Schema.
-   Bulk Import API now creates entities if they are not present during the import.
-   Table's TestSuite is migrated to EntityReference. Previously it used to store entire payload of TestSuite.
