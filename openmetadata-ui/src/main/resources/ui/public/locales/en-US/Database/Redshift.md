# Redshift
In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Redshift connector. You can view the full documentation for Redshift [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/redshift).

## Requirements

Redshift user must grant `SELECT` privilege on `SVV_TABLE_INFO` to fetch the metadata of tables and views.

```sql
-- Create a new user
-- More details https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_USER.html
CREATE USER test_user with PASSWORD 'password';

-- Grant SELECT on table
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE svv_table_info to test_user;
```

### Profiler & Data Quality

Executing the profiler Workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. The user should also be allowed to view information in `svv_table_info` for all objects in the database. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/profiler) and data quality tests [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality).

### Usage & Lineage

For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege on `STL_QUERY` table. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).

You can find further information on the Redshift connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/redshift).

## Connection Details

$$section
### Scheme $(id="scheme")
SQLAlchemy driver scheme options. If you are unsure about this setting, you can use the default value.
$$

$$section
### Username $(id="username")
Username to connect to Redshift. This user should have access to `SVV_TABLE_INFO` to extract metadata. Other workflows may require different permissions -- refer to the section above for more information.
$$

$$section
### Password $(id="password")
Password to connect to Redshift.
$$

$$section
### Host Port $(id="hostPort")
This parameter specifies the host and port of the Redshift instance. This should be specified as a string in the format `hostname:port`. For example, you might set the hostPort parameter to `localhost:5439`.

If you are running the OpenMetadata ingestion in a docker and your services are hosted on the `localhost`, then use `host.docker.internal:5439` as the value.
$$

$$section
### Database $(id="database")

Initial Redshift database to connect to. If you want to ingest all databases, set `ingestAllDatabases` to true. This should be specified as a string in the format `hostname:port`. E.g., `localhost:5439`, `host.docker.internal:5439`
$$

$$section
### Ingest All Databases $(id="ingestAllDatabases")
If ticked, the workflow will be able to ingest all database in the cluster. If not ticked, the workflow will only ingest tables from the database set above.
$$

$$section
### SSL Mode $(id="sslMode")
SSL Mode to connect to redshift database. E.g, `prefer`, `verify-ca` etc.
$$

$$section
### SSL CA $(id="caCertificate")
The CA certificate used for SSL validation (`sslrootcert`).
$$
$$note
Redshift only needs CA Certificate
$$
$$section
### Connection Options $(id="connectionOptions")
Additional connection options to build the URL that can be sent to service during the connection.
$$

$$section
### Connection Arguments $(id="connectionArguments")
Additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to service during connection.
